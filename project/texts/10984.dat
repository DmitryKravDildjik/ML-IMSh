seconds later in pulling gun than used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kids got girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that hundred yards down the at the edge of the maybe dont suppose she would but that would be good place to watch anyway rode down to the of the sun was low and the broad shade of the great already covered the grass hut the were for the night in brush near by few kids walked the top of it the leaves the old mexican lay upon blanket on the grass already in from his and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and touched glasses to their new world old his wrinkled face seemed to him to be and in the door of the stood and lieutenant sat in his saddle staring at her like at the cisco kid was vain person as all and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been had he known that at simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him never before had seen such man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and tissue and clear weather he seemed to the shadow of the when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his was no larger than herself with black straight hair and cold marble face that the as for though she description to the let her make of your fancy her hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the of the province as for the part of her that in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue gave you symbolic hint of the bird the newly lighted asked for drink of water brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter considered it necessary to so as to the trouble of her play no spy nor do assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but assert by the right that before quarter of an hour had was teaching her how to and had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the padre had given her and the little that she fed from bottle she would be very very lonely indeed which leads to suspicion that the kids needed and that the had fallen upon soil in his camp by the water hole lieutenant announced and his intention of either causing the cisco kid to the black of the country or of him before judge and jury that sounded twice week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the and directed slim slightly fingers among the of the slowly growing plait is hard to learn and easy to teach the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his ready and had frequent eye for the at the rear of the thus he might bring down the and the with one stone while the was his studies the cisco kid was also to his professional duties he shot up in small cow village on creek killed the town marshal him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away and no true artist is by shooting an aged man carrying an on his way the kid suddenly experienced the that all men feel when its keen edge of delight he for the woman he loved to him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his and his devotion he wanted to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the was on the bottle the kid turned the head up the flat that along the until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the the for he had sense of and direction equal to that of horse and he knew he would soon be the rich grass at the end of while rested his head in hut more weird and than the journey of an explorer is the ride of one through texas flat with and startling variety the and shapes of the lift their twisted trunks and fat hands to the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to the traveller with its grey it itself thousand times about what look to be open and paths only to lure the rider into blind and of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass in his head to be lost in the is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the about but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting the most fantastic and trail ever picked out the good the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made while they the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was man of conventional ideas he had voice like with but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words dont you monkey with my girl or ill tell you what ill do and so on the was to it and did not mind but even the singer will after certain time gain his own consent to from to the worlds noises so the kid by the time he was within mile or two of had reluctantly allowed his song to die because his performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his muscles were as though he were in circus ring the wheeled and danced through the of until at length his rider knew by certain that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the was he caught sight of the grass roof of the and the tree on the edge of the few yards farther the kid stopped the and gazed intently through the then he dropped the reins and proceeded on foot and silent like an indian the knowing his part stood still making no sound the kid crept to the very edge of the and between the leaves of of cactus ten yards from his in the shade of the sat his calmly so far she might surely escape women have been known from time to time to engage in more but if all must be told there is to be added that her head against the broad and comfortable chest of tall man and that his arm was about her her fingers that required so many lessons at the six strand plait glanced quickly at the dark mass of when he heard slight sound that was not altogether unfamiliar gun will make that sound when one the handle of six suddenly but the sound was not repeated and fingers needed close attention and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid remember then said you must not come again until send for you soon he will be here at the said today he saw him on the three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until send you the word all right said the stranger and then what and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you he man to surrender sure said its kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape you used to think right much of him said dropped the twisted herself around and curved lemon arm over the shoulder but then she murmured in liquid spanish had not thee thou great red mountain of man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me how can know when he comes asked when he comes said he remains two days sometimes three the small son of old the has swift pony will write letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the is not to strike than is el as they call him to send ball from his the kids handy with his gun sure enough admitted but when come for him shall come alone ill get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid and ill do the rest will send you the message by the boy said the girl knew you were than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could ever have thought cared for him it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of with one arm high from the earth for salute the of the summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the where the in the iron pot rose straight as above the chimney no sound or movement disturbed the of the dense ten yards away when the form of had disappeared his big dun down the steep banks of the crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the trail he had come but not far he stopped and waited in the silent depths of the until half an hour had passed and then heard the high notes of his singing coming nearer and nearer and she ran to the edge of the to meet him the kid seldom smiled but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her he and his girl sprang into his arms the kid looked at her his thick black hair clung to his head like wrinkled mat the meeting brought slight of some of feeling to his smooth dark face that was usually as motionless as clay mask my girl he asked holding her close sick of waiting so long for you dear one she answered my eyes are dim with always gazing into that through which you come and can see into it such little way too but you are here beloved one and will not que mal muchacho not to come to see your alma more often go in and rest and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope there

be good deal obliged besides his the kid had another attribute for which he admired himself greatly he was muy caballero as the express it where the ladies were concerned for them he had always gentle words and consideration he could not have spoken harsh word to woman he might their and brothers but he could not have laid the weight of finger in anger upon woman many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his declared their in the stories about mr kid one believe everything one heard they said when by their men folk with proof of the deeds of they said maybe he had been driven to it and that he knew how to treat lady anyhow considering this extremely of the kid and the pride he took in it one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding place in the that afternoon at least as to one of the must have been by difficulties and yet one could not think of the kid little matters of that kind at the end of the short twilight they gathered around supper of goat and coffee by the light of lantern in the afterward the his flock smoked cigarette and became in grey blanket washed the few dishes while the kid dried them with the towel her eyes shone she of the of her small world since the kids last visit it was as all his other had been then outside swung in grass with her guitar

earth he waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the one in clothes quickly mounted the horse and past the toward the crossing and village and then the other figure in skirt waist and over its head stepped out into the faint moonlight gazing after the rider thought he would take his chance then before rode back he she might not care to see it throw up your hands he ordered loudly stepping out of the wagon shed with his at his shoulder there was quick turn of the figure but no movement to obey so the ranger in the then twice more for you never could be too sure of bringing down the cisco kid there was no danger of missing at ten paces even in that half moonlight the old asleep on his blanket was by the shots listening further he heard great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish and rose up at the disturbing ways of the tall red ghost of man burst into the reaching one hand shaking like reed for the lantern hanging on its nail the other spread letter on
