последний визит здоровье вчера убиться пока перевести поделиться автор админ зарегистрирован приглашение сообщение пол женский возраст последний визит ещё одна really just regular guy but ask me to chill out roberts roberts meet the hollywood star of the pearl harbor who made his on the west end stage this week in stark room in south london the lights flash on and off at random and at ft in himself into plastic chair he jeans and hat and still has the looks that got him spotted by talent scout as yet despite more than decade in the he is uncomfortable being he says he the fame game that hes just regular guy that he the of yet hes so in by and that he gives every impression of believing himself to be really very famous the west end nica burns sits next to him and occasionally answers questions for him and boy does he hate being asked about heath who was friend im not even going to go there he unhappy when ask whether he him british it turns out are told not to mention as result why so defensive he says hes had bad experiences with the press and most often he during his relationship with with whom he lived in new york his silence on the subject of former is absolute and perhaps fair enough he says hes been stalked by the us and that even stepping outside his front door became difficult at one stage people have written wild things about me he the trick so many people learn and that am reluctant to learn is to be hurt and cover it up and that everything is ok all the time when its not dont like to act in my personal life like to be look started this very young and had media training so go figure is appearing in the stage adaptation of the rain man movie that won for hoffman and director barry and the concept of the he plays charlie the tom cruise role the younger brother to the raymond played here by british actor adam its bold project partly because the film road movie so large in the cultural consciousness but also because acted on stage for years wanna stretch myself he says try new things get quite fed up being on film set day after day six days week it can get to be want to have what do always feel fresh and new and this play does to me mean film adaptation is not necessarily my first choice for the first piece of theatre done in years but the script was so impressive and wanted to show myself that could do it still basically have short attention span so be good for me to try and stay in one space doing the same thing for four months it was on stage at theatre school in new york that was first noticed talent scout him off to screen in la he was and very very handsome in that mildly fashion that often passes on american tv for proper he on several occasions for part in creek and im amazed he get one for while however convinced that he even wanted to be an actor and certainly not an actor hired for his beauty in teen horror such as one of his first features yet role in the virgin was followed by black hawk down and then the epic pearl harbor the part captain danny walker that was to him to hollywood became popular very young he says with huge sigh myself as just young actor trying to figure out how to do well and you know making mistakes and learning and growing and then happened to be picked up for certain movie and they let the publicity machine go wild and ended up at the centre of that and was as lot of things that never claimed to be was the next harrison ford the next tom cruise the next action hero never mind that the film was critical agent was up one big movie after another including which he turned down fame was this kind of blunt tool that was thrust into my hands very young he says by far the most interesting thing about him think is his decision to from the status pearl harbor upon him to turn your back on the fame so many people seem to is surely the act of complex thoughtful person its choice of which hes proud after pearl harbor he simply went home to liberal minnesota where he and his three were brought up largely by their father property manager and jazz who once played with al green for the next year he his agents yeah that was pretty much the end of that relationship and hung out with old friends he himself as totally odd kid growing up who found his in the theatre and just for moment flash of dry wit here too as young he took job at video store and got to watch movies all day story that me of who also worked in video shop dogs and his own obsession for film yeah cool when mention qt but like was like the comic store guy from the that was more me it was pretty much the only job could hold down yet he that he suffered any kind of crisis harbor he just enjoy maybe even get his status know what fame was good for he says now figured out that you can use it to raise awareness for certain certain issues but it was living in bowl that made it so difficult some people would say plus but its not something can do retreated from this idea of chasing fame its too much for me to handle instead he has taken year off here year off there and made movies he really wanted to make hollywood working with harrison ford brian de the black the crime lucky number and superior horror feature days of night he is also starting to produce his own films and has released movie called august set in the month before against the of in new york stars and wow david has gone back to that idea of trying to steadily grow as an artist he says im not the idea that been very lucky but if can use the fame factor to create these films think are intelligent cool and different its the best of all worlds balance you must strike in this industry im not ignorant of that fact just want to make sure im falling on the right side of it he slightly the side of integrity over monetary gain or fame guess he is he says what does he worry about everything not to worry about seriously some people just have this personality it starts on domestic level then it moves into personal relations then into national or world affairs dont think hes entirely joking here if everything is going well in my life then start to read the papers more and start to worry about everything cant deal with they say wisdom is knowing what you can fix and what you cant change im very he will miss the us election but healthy degree of about the influence of hollywood stars on proceedings lot of have decided to out their opinions dont care to be involved in that yet he still parties when he can or when hes allowed to so far in london hes barely got out of this room but his friends in the kings of leon are coming to town and he to hang out with them he some new york bands as his current not that he falls out of though heavens no enjoy going out when was young he says because was and thought dont want to be one of those who every night out in clubs trying to find girls or whatever then kind of got little more secure in who was and realised could have good time occasionally dont go to clubs often but like to see bands you know as for london well trouble is thinks the british papers will him while hes here on the one hand hes up for meeting the normal if have time and end up in situation where people want to talk about something done or doing or just movies or acting or the weather here and how it of course ill talk about that but on the other hes sure of gossip and are watching his every move so they can write more mean stories when you have that sort of fame and attention being paid to you by the never going to meet anyone so the point if you step outside the door you end up in situation where people have seen you and they can say whatever they want to say about you and the only factor they need is that you were there all they need so look im sure will be success in rain man and im sure when hes hes most young man but when see him hes clearly too about his fame the very thing he wants to escape to speak his days later receive call from his british feel relaxed during his interview and would like to meet him again sure fine say surprised later the same me back er us says can have minutes with him that shed like to vet the questions and that there are certain and conditions and as they say in america enough already поделиться автор людмила админ откуда феодосия крым украина зарегистрировать приглашение сообщение пол женский skype последний выходить

not so hot on the tag having for the scene is on quest to be taken seriously and making his west end is all part of that strategy he tells alice jones by this time next week the critics will have seen and delivered their on west end in rain man not that the year old movie star is too bothered the critics always give me hard time so what do care he says in the west end at least there are more critics so more chance at fair trial only one that really matters on broadway and if they dont like you screwed the chances of the new york times shining to hollywood actor coming in for his first play are slim would be hanging myself in new york that said its not exactly been smooth ride for since he arrived in london little over month ago the production has been by of with change of director terry johnson replaced david putting opening night back by days and then with the british hes the daily mirror for story which playing on his links to some of the worlds most beautiful women including and that he had sexual in the library of the hotel im not going to say that im saint that never done anything wrong in my life but if going to find something out about me personally at least find something true he hes finding it hard to enjoy london thanks to permanent tail of though hes dressed down today in black grey and there is something hollywood about as he his ft in frame behind the tiny table in on high street two girls past unable to tear their eyes away from him while the just little too long as she his he still managed to make an in midnight performance of hamlet at globe last weekend with the company the factory who stage their plays all over london it was he breaks into his first smile they ripped out page of the book and said here going to do this it looks like more fun to be part of than anything you can imagine on stage back in his day job plays tom part charlie in the new stage version of the film while adam plays his brother which was an turn for hoffman take on the role that would me in the best light he says gonna come out of the play and say wow tour de force performance by its towards the rain man but the more interesting character in my mind is charlie because its the harder sell this is first stage for years since he performed the opera at drama school but never been the star of play in front of an audience this big got lucky when was really young worked my ass off to get there but nobody really saw that been considered just kid who was handed this career grew up in minnesota his father played guitar with al green and his joe jessica and jake all have musical on leaving catholic school did my bible learning but made the decision not to be religious aged he entered the theatre programme at the state university of new york legend has it that he was plucked from there for in fact he was kicked out after six months knew had options and pushed my luck with an for the thin red line under his belt he get it he wrote to the dean of the programme telling him that constant were the students creativity the dean he says responded by asking him to leave once in los angeles he did and in two weeks had landed two parts the first in the us version of then he was cast in the virgin and the faculty his cool turns led to the parts in the pearl harbour and black hawk down up until that point had the critics on my side they were really digging what was doing then pearl harbour was the event that it was and nobody likes to be told what to like had people who wanted to tear me down after that it all happened really quickly was years old so he did the quit why would expose myself to that everybody screwed me when even be out of college in my real life he escaped home for nearly two years wrote movie with his best friend wish you were here which bought but never made painted and turned down every part he was offered including of and had to change agents after that he tad tempted by are you kidding no role like that can define you and its not very definition it make people think wow what an artist you have that on your chest for the rest of your career were his two highest profile films an then totally the chance to star opposite harrison ford in hollywood broke his resolve but his choices since have been and there been anything that gone into thinking this is going to be crap im just doing it to help my career not one thing so can sleep well he has been though as the face of an armani in which feature him being by women as go off that was strange he but says the high profile it gave him has allowed him to various independent projects including the august about and come with the rain with the director hung turned this year and stopped smoking to mark the occasion it was terrifying before the birthday happened remember feeling old when was but now im the same age as my dad was when he had me im old enough to be father so hes ready to settle down dont think can right now lot of things want to do at home in new york he the by hanging out with and artist friends and to one set of famous kings of leon they were supposed to come to my play last night then show bastards hes more of music fan than movie fan and to wolf parade and bon music that him of childhood summers at his log cabin in wisconsin and he constantly fishing in plastic bag for the books he bought at the shop on the way to our interview the sky the and gabriel garcia one of my he them on the table turning the towards me so can copy down the titles in this one move you sense overwhelming desire to be taken seriously and no reason why he be having made and more interesting decisions than most but unfortunately for him it seems its going to take more than few films and on stage for him to shake off the hollywood tag as he out of the he leaves of in his wake was it him the one from pearl harbour they twitter in the doorway yes it was and hes in that armani rain man to december apollo theatre london источник

and heads our way in search of lights and on the west end stage does it make you groan with deja vu or are you excited about getting to get so close to your idol you can literally feel the stage fright dripping off them only ask because right now we have another young screen star over here to prove his acting in front of some of the critics in the world career thus far has seen him something of teen but in recent years hes made an effort to move towards somewhat darker fare now hes is he hoping move onto the stage will show the world hes now grown up we catch up with him at the apollo theatre just as hes about to open in rain man the new stage adaptation of the movie it feels great he smiles despite fighting sore throat which has come along at exactly the wrong time done theatre show in about years so to have live audience and to be able to react to them has been lot of fun its kind of like the closest ill get to being rock star im now you cant be rock star after can you rain man was of course massive success on the big screen in the best picture oscar as well as from the academy for of the raymond that role raymond is played by british actor adam he is instead following in the footsteps of tom cruise playing brother charlie so how is he coping following in the footsteps of the most famous actor in the world dont want to have his interpretation of the role influence mine even though he did great job obviously everybody loved what they did in the movie but obviously for me to try and their performance would just be wrong the audience be as engaged if look at the material and take my own approach then its argument over whether hollywood stars should get so much attention when they come over to perform in the west end to be raised by the you see many members of the public shaking their heads when offered chance to see christian val or close up close and personal probably why all of their in london over recent years have led to near in fact few years back suggested sales in had more than during particularly months but some like sir alan who american in the capital worry that the attention on from the actual play itself he also the quality of the performance from screen actor would fall well below that of stage that seemed little harsh can bring stronger presence which surely certain
